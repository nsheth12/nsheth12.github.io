I'm Nihar, and I'm an undergrad at the [University of Southern California](https://www.usc.edu/). Although I study CS, my interests lie in both technology and investing.

In the past, I've interned at:
- [Google](https://careers.google.com/), where I worked on data quarantining for GDPR compliance on the Travel team
- [Two Sigma](https://www.twosigma.com/), where I built pre-processing systems for TS's vast droves of financial data
- [Topline Capital](https://toplinecapital.com/), where I researched nano-cap and micro-cap stocks.

Right now (as of 7-18-2020), I'm interning at [Instabase](https://news.crunchbase.com/news/instabase-raises-massive-105m-series-b-reaches-unicorn-status/).
